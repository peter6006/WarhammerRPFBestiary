If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.\n\nStomp\nCreatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0.\n\nWounds\nLarger creatures have more Wounds:\nSize - Wounds\nTiny - 1\nLittle - Toughness Bonus\nSmall - (2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus\nAverage - Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus\nLarge - (Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2\nEnormous - (Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4\nMonstrous - (Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8"
